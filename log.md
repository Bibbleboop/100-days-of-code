# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 13th June 2024

**Today's Progress**: I have found a way to show up everyday with the plan to code full time! 

Joined 100-days-of-code to brush up on rusty bits and plan for the future. 

**Thoughts:** This will be like riding a bike I'm sure. For now I need a quick refresh on Markdown, VSCode while l I fork this Repo
